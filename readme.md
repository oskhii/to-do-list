Hello!
This is a To Do List for Project 1

You can add things to do to the list, you can mark them as complete, and you can remove them.
The input will be checked for blank as well as being too short (less than 3 characters) or too long (more than 20 characters).  
The page will also count the number of things the list has.

This project meets all the specified application requirements for Todo-lists, except for the information being stored in a browser eg. localstorage, but has the counter as an additional function instead.
